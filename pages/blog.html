<p>"The Starry Night" is an iconic painting created by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh in June 1889. It is considered
    one of the most recognized and celebrated works of art in the world. This masterpiece depicts the view from Van
    Gogh's asylum room window at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, France, where he resided for a year. </p>

<p>The painting features a swirling, tumultuous sky filled with stars, a large crescent moon, and various celestial
    elements. The small village below is illuminated by the brilliant night sky. Van Gogh employed his distinctive
    impasto technique, using thickly applied paint in bold, expressive brushstrokes, to create a sense of movement and
    dynamism in the sky.

</p>
<p>its serene appearance, "The Starry Night" also reflects the artist's inner turmoil and emotional struggles.
    Van Gogh painted this masterpiece during a period of personal turmoil and mental instability, shortly after he
    admitted himself to the asylum following a severe breakdown. Through this work, Van Gogh expressed his profound
    connection to nature and the cosmos, as well as his deep introspection and spiritual longing.</p>
