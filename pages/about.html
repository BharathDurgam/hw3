    <b>Hello, this is Bharath Durgam currently persuing masters in computer science at OCU. I've completed my bachelors
        and diploma in computers in 2021 and I have two years of experience as an Application Development Associate at
        Accenture Solutions pvt lmt. I'm a quick learner and passionate to build a better career. I'm constantly
        improving my skills. I have knowledge on few of the programming languages like java, html, css, javascript,
        python. And I'm flexible with operating platforms.
        If we talk about the present web site that I build. I only used basic html coding which includes tags like
        !DOCTYPE html, html, head, meta, title, body, header, nav, ul, li-list, a-anchor, main, h?, p-paragraph, footer.
        b-bold. Anchor tag is used here for redirecting and navigating through the other web pages and total 3 web pages
        are created in this project.
        Thanks to Prof. Tashfeen for this opportunity.
